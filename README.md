## Set Up:
- 1: Git clone 
- 2: Cd into 'overlook'
- 3: Cd into src 
- 4: Open index.html 
- 5: Test out the APP

## What is it:
A JavaScript based project, that utilizes fetching API dataSets to allow a user or manager to check into their own booking page of the OverLook APP. Once logged in the user or manager should see the appropriate page and data needed to navigate the site, make hotel room bookings, search by date and names.



## Why?
For this specific APP,
### As a Manager: 
We aimed to be able to login as the manager. While managing the APP, we wanted the Manager to be able to see a dashboard page that shows:

 - Total Rooms Available for today’s date
 - Total revenue for today’s date
 - Percentage of rooms occupied for today’s date.
 - Should be able to search for any user by name and:
    - View their name
    - A list of all of their bookings, 
    - The total amount they’ve spent
    - Add a room booking for that user
    - Delete any upcoming room bookings for that user (they cannot delete a booking from the past)

### As a User: 
We aimed to be able to login as the user. While using the APP, we wanted the User to be able to see a dashboard page that shows:

 - Any room bookings I have made (past or present/upcoming)
 - The total amount I have spent on rooms
 - I should be able to select a date for which I’d like to book a room for myself:
 - Upon selecting a date:
     - I should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date
     - I should be able to filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property
     - I should be able to select a room for booking
     - In the event that no rooms are available for the date/roomType selected, display a message fiercely apologizing to the
     user and asking them to adjust their room search
